# Spotify API with Gulp
This project connects to the spotify API and displays information based on the user's search query. It uses the Gulp-Sass plugin to compile the CSS. Upon submiting the search, it will display an album list below the search form. 

Luckily, Spotify has decent documentation. That made this project a lot easier. You do have to create an account to use the API. If you would like to do so, you can visit here:
